This project is created to support the talk, "Introduction to IoT".

You can find the talk at [Slide Share](https://www.slideshare.net/WesleyEldridge), the live stream on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo6OzvDm9Ozpl3O-LkMGsaQ/videos).

# In this Repo

You will find two projects in this repo. The first project is a basic hello world
for the device. The second project is a hello world app that works over the cloud.
The projects can be found in the follow directories.

* [LEDBlink](https://github.com/weseldridge/ParticleLEDHelloWorld/tree/master/LEDBlink)
* [LEDCloudBlink](https://github.com/weseldridge/ParticleLEDHelloWorld/tree/master/LEDCloudBlink)

The code in each of the projects was adapted from the Particle Getting Started guide.
You can find the LEDBlink example, [here](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/examples/core/#blink-an-led). The LEDCloudBlink example can be found [here](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/examples/core/#control-leds-over-the-39-net).
